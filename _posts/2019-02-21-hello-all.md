title: "Do you sound smarter when you use big words?"
published: true

**_"According to a study published in Applied Cognitive Psychology, the answer is no."_**

In fact, complex writing makes you sound small-minded. Just consider the title of the study: _Consequences of erudite vernacular utilized irrespective of necessity: problems with using long words needlessly._

Wouldn’t it be better to title this study something like _The effect of using big words when you don’t need them?_

To sound smart, you must stop _trying_ to sound smart.  
Brilliant writing is simple writing, a relevant idea delivered clearly and directly.
